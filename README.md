# LDA_supervised_learning
This repository contains the code used to create a function that could preform Linear Discriminate Analysis on the freshwater.xlsx data set and create confusion matrices with the original data and new data. This function can be used on any dataset no matter how large. This function will be used to predict water quality based on RGB values on a test strip.
